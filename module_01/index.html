<h1>A basic HTML template</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript and mapping.</p>
<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
<p>I enjoyed the article and thought it made some wonderful points. The example of the difference in results when googling restaurants in Hebrew, English, and Arabic elucidated the bias inherent in mapping and, especially, in large-scale web mapping. The tone of the article made it easier to read. If it were written in stuffy academese it would limit the audience, and I think reaching outside of academia with this is important.</p>
<p>The article also did a good job highlighting different skillsets and outlooks individuals bring to mapmaking: coders, cartographers, and critics. Specializing in any one of these areas without an understanding or appreciation for the other areas creates problems and results in poor maps with either inaccuracies, poor design, or biases.</p>
<p>My only criticism would be that the article may show a bit of bias in the description of the three categories. In my reading, coders are looked at especially negative and are stereotyped as antisocial and there are no positives actually mentioned of coders. While the criticism that coders may be too quick to jump to new technology and see the technology as the most important component of mapping may be valid, the article does not mention that this technology is still absolutely vital and webmapping, of course, would not exist without coders - but, it would exist (in a worse shape) without cartographers and critics.</p>
<p>The essay takes a much more positive view of critics (it even refers to them as "funamental" - which, I think is a better description for coders as far as webmapping is concerned).</p>
<p>My skills aren't there yet - but, it would be interesting to look at the three descriptions with a sentiment analysis script. I would guess that critics are looked at most favorably, followed by cartographers, and coders the least favorably.</p>
